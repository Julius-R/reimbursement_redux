# Reimbursement Application

[View Live Version Here](https://reimbursementapp.herokuapp.com/)

This project was a way for me to test multiple tools that I had an interest in working with.
The project was built using Next.Js, Prisma, and with-iron-session.

## Running Locally

Since this is connected to an actual database, the env variables will not be shared.
However, one is able to clone the repo and provide their own database information to test and use this project.
